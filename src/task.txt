A. Prepare automation test using Java for the following flow:
1. Register on https://www.goodreads.com/
2. Login with invalid credentials
3. Login with valid credentials
4. Search for "Best crime and mystery books"
5. Mark top 3 books as "Want to read"
6. Mark as read
7. Rate and leave feedback for them (add different read dates)
8. Logout
As a result we need code and videocast of performed tests.
